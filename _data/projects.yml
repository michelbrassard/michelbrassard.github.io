          description: Third project for the NMDE-111 course. The task was to think of an app and create promotional material for it.

            - text: This is a third project for the [[nmde-link]]. It is a promotional poster for a hypothetical food delivery app called DeliverEat.

            - title: Name
              text: The name would be pronounced as “deliver it”, but instead of “it” the word “eat” was used to associate it with food.
            - title: Icon
              text: For the icon, I imagined a bag that is moving very fast with cutlery in the center to signal fast delivery, and again to associate it with food.
            - title: Poster
              text: In the poster, I added a white shape that resembles pac-man to better isolate the call to action buttons for downloading the app, but it also worked as another association to food and eating.

            - title: Theme
              text: In that period, a lot of times, I would play the reality show as a “background” when I was completing homeworks, projects or doing chores. That is how I came to this idea to use it as the theme for this project.
            - title: Elements
              text: For the background, I put some famous phrases said during the show, either by Gordon Ramsey or someone else in the show. On the forefront there is a plate full of unpleasant items. There are loose hairs, a cockroach, a dead rat without a tail, and a half eaten rotting apple. The items on the plate were made by image tracing existing images, but the plate itself is a light gray circle with circular lines. The lines were filled with a gradient (spanning from white to dark gray) so that they resemble the highlights and shadows of a plate. Also, the circle itself drops a shadow to give off a 3D-like effect.

            - title: Pages
              text: The first page is an introductory landing page with the summary of all restaurant information that shows up on hover. For the layout I used a 3x3 grid and spanned the cards accordingly where I implemented the rule of thirds. The idea for that was to let hypothetical users see the information right away so that they don't need to go to specific pages to retrieve information. The second page shows a list of menu items with images, names, and prices of the dishes. The third page is for details that show the hypothetical location and work hours of the restaurant. The fourth page is for the contact information.
            - title: Design
              text: "For the colors, I picked a yellow color scheme because it resembles fast food restaurants like McDonalds. In addition to that, I added the frosted glass/blurred effect for the background which was inspired by Apple's UI. For the typography I used a generic sans-serif font (in the CSS file just font-family: sans-serif;)"
            - title: Name idea
              text: The idea for the name “Your Favourites!” didn't have much thought as this restaurant “sells” hamburgers, pizzas, pancakes and chocolate cakes. A lot of people can say that these are one of their favourite foods so the ad is “marketing” to those customers.
