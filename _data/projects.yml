          description: A real estate management platform supported by a private blockchain. Senior developmet group project (ISTE-500/501).
          content: 
            - text: Realex.in (“relax in” or "real" as in real estate) is a multiuser web application for managing investments of non-standard vacation homes. The application has a traditional frontend and backend, but it also utilizes a private blockchain. This project is a senior group assignment for the [[course-link]], and a capstone project for the Web and Mobile bachelor's degree.

            - title: Idea
              text: For this course, it is not the professor, or the students that comes up with an idea, it is an external person, a client/sponsor, that presents a certain problem, and it is up to students to explore, and solve it if possible. 
            - text: The client's “problem” was that there isn't any real public control when it comes to building non-standard vacation homes. Usually, a person or a company with enough capital will build something, and then rent it on Airbnb, or resell it to someone else. The point was that people in general don't have a say on whether they would like to have something built or not.
            - text: The sponsor's idea was to create a web application with blockchain support that will try and solve this problem, and it was up to my teammates and I to establish concrete features and build a minimum viable product. 
            - title: Roles
              text: There are 3 roles for this application, an admin, creator, and regular user. A regular user, in short, can invest in a property and buy/sell tokens, a creator can post, edit, delete property ideas, and the admin can verify idea creators, and approve new property ideas. 
            - title: Application flow
              text: When it comes to the application flow, we can begin with a user who finds a property idea, and invests in it. Later, after the property receives enough funds, construction begins. After it is done, the investor picks the dates of their stay, and receives tokens that are stored on the blockchain. With the tokens, the investor can either use them to stay in the newly constructed property (stay dates are defined on the smart contract) or sell them to the secondary market.
            - title: Solution
              text: The idea for the solution was to allow the public to decide whether they want to build something by investing in some property idea (voting with wallets), and to allow proposing real estate ideas without having the necessary funds right away.
            - title: Clarification
              text: The main difference between Airbnb and Realex.in is that it deals with investments, not existing properties. The point is that people invest in some idea/plan for the property, potentially realize it, and then, as a reward, they will be able to stay in that property. 
            - title: Security
              text: As this platform would deal with large amounts of capital, for the current solution, verification goes through the admin (admin can see all the needed documents that are uploaded by the creator for a certain property idea).
            - title: Opensanctions
              text: When the admin views users, data from [[opensanctions]] is retrieved which is used to mimic a KYC check.

                  external: true
            - title: Blockchain
              text: One of the requirements for the project was to utilize blockchain. My teammates and I decided to use it only for the most critical part of the application. In this case, it is for the tokens, or better explained as “tickets” that grant a user the ability to stay in the place they have invested in. For everything else, a regular database was used, because it is much better for regular CRUD operations. One of the downsides of this way is that on-chain, and off-chain data had to be synchronised.
            - text: "[[fabric]] was used because it is a private blockchain. A solution with a public blockchain like Ethereum could be implemented, but it seemed like a better choice to use Hyperledger because it designed for businesses, and it may be easier to deal with regulations like GDPR if its a private one."

                  external: true
            - title: Team
              text: There were 6 of us in the team. (designer, frontend, backend developers, QA, documentation writer, team lead)
            - text: I was the team lead, and I acted as a “bridge” between the sponsor, and the development team. This means I organized meetings, established use cases, worked on the work breakdown structure, and on the project plan. I also helped with the presentations, gate reviews, and sponsor reports. I haven’t done much programming for this project, only at the end of the development phase on the frontend side (bug fixes, minor features). 
            - title: Final notes
              text: The project itself is tricky to understand, and there are a lot of unexplored scenarios and even potential legal issues (when dealing with large amounts of capital an app has to follow regulations, KYC, AML, GDPR…) that are not addressed with this application, but I think that it is important to emphasize the process of getting to some solution, communicating with the sponsor, reaching a consensus, planning, organizing everything, and synchronising with the team.

          description: A Dash plotly web app that visualizes PDF bank statements. A project for the ISTE-470 course. 
          content: 
            - text: This web app allows users to upload PDF bank statements from [[pbz]], and transform them into a calendar heatmap. In the map, a darker color represents a larger spending amount for that day. In addition to that, tiles can be clicked, after which a pie chart will be shown that lists transactions performed for that day. Above that section, a selection picker is added so that a user can choose between different uploaded months (multiple bank statements can be added at same time). It is the final project for the [[course-link]].

            - title: parsing
              text: The parsing algorithm uses pdfplumber to turn pdfs into text by isolating the table from the PDF, and then additional cleanup functions are used to remove unnecessary words or characters. 
            - title: Limitations
              text: For now, it only parses PDFs from PBZ, but the app could theoretically be extended to support other bank statements too without too much problems. I personally had bank statements from PBZ which is why I worked with them for this project.
            - title: Issues
              text: A tricky part for this app is that the structure of the PDFs changes throughout time. Meaning, documents from 2022 are not the same as ones from 2024, there are slight differences.

            - title: Topic
              text: For the topic, my teammates and I chose chemistry as it combines well with an escape room type game. A player has to combine elements, create new compounds, and use them to progress the game. The recipes are somewhat grounded in reality (they are not made up, but they are simplified). For example, a player has to pick up zinc and copper, create sheets from that, combine it with acid, and with it assemble a battery.
            - title: Turn based
              text: Each player has 20 seconds for their turn to progress as much as possible. When a turn ends, the game of the current player is paused, and then the other player can begin their turn. This repeats until one of the players escapes, making them the winner of the game. 
            - title: Chat
              text: In the lobby, players can chat before the game starts. (bottom left corner)

          content: 
            - text: This is the first project for the [[course-link]]. It is a pure frontend application for ordering sandwiches from a hypothetical sandwich shop. Its data is fetched from a file, and after ordering, it is saved to local storage (mimicking fetching and sending from a backend without dealing with APIs). This project was more of an exercise for learning and implementing the MVC pattern using the object oriented approach with JavaScript.

              text: For the background, I put some famous phrases said during the show, either by Gordon Ramsey or someone else in the show. On the forefront there is a plate full of unpleasant items. There are loose hairs, a cockroach, a dead rat without a tail, and a half eaten rotting apple. The items on the plate were made by image tracing existing images, but the plate itself is a light gray circle with circular lines. The lines were filled with a gradient (spanning from white to dark gray) so that they resemble the highlights and shadows of a plate. Also, the circle itself drops a shadow to give off a 3D-like effect.

              text: For this project, I had to make different variations of the design which is why some styleboards or moodboards may not correspond to the final version.

The project had 5 pages, but the main difference between this project and project one ([[your-favourites-link]]) is that the topic was given by the professor, and the task was to also do some research around the topic.

            - title: Pages
              text: The first page is an introductory landing page with the summary of all restaurant information that shows up on hover. For the layout I used a 3x3 grid and spanned the cards accordingly where I implemented the rule of thirds. The idea for that was to let hypothetical users see the information right away so that they don't need to go to specific pages to retrieve information. The second page shows a list of menu items with images, names, and prices of the dishes. The third page is for details that show the hypothetical location and work hours of the restaurant. The fourth page is for the contact information.
            - title: Design
              text: "For the colors, I picked a yellow color scheme because it resembles fast food restaurants like McDonalds. In addition to that, I added the frosted glass/blurred effect for the background which was inspired by Apple's UI. For the typography I used a generic sans-serif font (in the CSS file just font-family: sans-serif;)"
            - title: Name idea
              text: The idea for the name “Your Favourites!” didn't have much thought as this restaurant “sells” hamburgers, pizzas, pancakes and chocolate cakes. A lot of people can say that these are one of their favourite foods so the ad is “marketing” to those customers.
