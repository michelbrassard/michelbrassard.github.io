(no frameworks allowed, pure HTML, CSS, and JS if needed)

The requirements were similar to the previous projects, but a bit more strict regarding styling, layout, and project structure. Students needed to embed other media (videos, links, sound files), and have more content comparatively. For the topic; I have chosen to research about blue whales.
